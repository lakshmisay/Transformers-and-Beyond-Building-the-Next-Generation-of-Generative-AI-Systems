# GenAI Book - Practical Jupyter Notebooks

Welcome to the official code repository for the book:  
**_Generative AI: From Foundations to Real-World Deployment_ ✨**

This repo offers chapter-wise, hands-on Jupyter notebooks to help you **learn, implement, and experiment** with Generative AI models and systems — covering everything from transformer architectures to fine-tuning, LangChain agents, and real-world deployments.

## How to Use

### 1. Setup Environment

**Using pip:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
---
Using conda:

bash
Copy
Edit
conda create -n genai python=3.10
conda activate genai
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Launch Notebooks
Open the terminal and run:

bash

jupyter notebook
Capstone Projects
Explore hands-on, end-to-end notebooks to apply everything you've learned:

Capstone_Agent_RAG_Chatbot.ipynb
→ Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation Agent using LangChain, FAISS, and OpenAI or Hugging Face models.

Capstone_Multimodal_App.ipynb
→ Develop a Multimodal AI App combining text, images, and speech using transformers and foundational models.

These projects are GPU-accelerated and production-aligned — ideal for both research and prototyping.
